Look, I ain't above hitting a dog or two, you know what I'm saying? I've been around the block a few times, and the only thing I hate more than the cops, are small yappy dogs. I *tried* to eat one's head, once, but my crybaby friends were all, *"Nooooo! You're always trying to eat wildlife, stop or I'll pee everywhere,"* Nobody realizes that a girl has **GOT. TO. EAT.** Anyway, cats are fine though.
