Yeah I'll get up on the mic and throw **down!** What are you looking at me like that for? *Listen* I know that it seems like I'm just standing up there on edge of the stage. Gripping onto the microphone with white knuckles and jittering, but that doesn't mean I'm scared! That's my hype up game, you fools. None of ya want to stick around and waiting for me to enter into an anxiety induced delirium that invokes confidence in me via now-compromised situational awareness? Sounds like you should go listen to Panic! At the Disco.

*The price is high because I have mad stage fright though...*
