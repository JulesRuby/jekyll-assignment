    	<h1>Dark Tranquility Atoma</h1>
<h3>09 Jul 2017 - Pugsly "Defy the" Matrix</h3>

<p>Dark Tranquility, one of the more prominent Swedish melodic death metal bands, has been dishing out one great album after another since their 1993 release <em>Skydancer</em>. For 13 years they have been defining the genre, so it is completely disheartening to hear their latest album, <em>Atoma</em>. The meat, albeit bland, is definitely in the middle of the album: “Neutrality,” “Clearing Skies,” and “When the World Screams,” have the elements of a classic DT song: the speed and the energy a longtime fan has come to expect.</p>

<p>However, it’s not enough to make up for the watered-down goth rock that infiltrates the first few songs, overshadowing the rest of the album. The overbearing clean vocals, are way too prominent throughout and don’t offer up a pleasant contrast with the harsh – as is the expected – melodeath formula.</p>

<p>Coming into this expecting any of the passion we heard on <em>Haven</em>, or more recently <em>We Are the Void</em>, is a huge disservice. A few of the tracks on the album are almost redeeming, but the oscillation between the bland, hard rock-styled songs and the traditional melodic death songs is far too unstable, unpredictable and unenjoyable. There is just too much uninspired fluff to make this a notable album.</p>
