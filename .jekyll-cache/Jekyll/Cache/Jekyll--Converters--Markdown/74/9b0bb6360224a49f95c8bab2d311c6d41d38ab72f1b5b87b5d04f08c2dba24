I"Å<p>Look, I ainâ€™t above hitting a dog or two, you know what Iâ€™m saying? Iâ€™ve been around the block a few times, and the only thing I hate more than the cops, are small yappy dogs. I <em>tried</em> to eat oneâ€™s head, once, but my crybaby friends were all, <em>â€œNooooo! Youâ€™re always trying to eat wildlife, stop or Iâ€™ll pee everywhere,â€</em> Nobody realizes that a girl has <strong>GOT. TO. EAT.</strong> Anyway, cats are fine though.</p>
