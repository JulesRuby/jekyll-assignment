I"$<p>Dark Tranquility, one of the more prominent Swedish melodic death metal bands, has been dishing out one great album after another since their 1993 release <em>Skydancer</em>. For 13 years they have been defining the genre, so it is completely disheartening to hear their latest album, <em>Atoma</em>. The meat, albeit bland, is definitely in the middle of the album: “Neutrality,” “Clearing Skies,” and “When the World Screams,” have the elements of a classic DT song: the speed and the energy a longtime fan has come to expect.</p>
