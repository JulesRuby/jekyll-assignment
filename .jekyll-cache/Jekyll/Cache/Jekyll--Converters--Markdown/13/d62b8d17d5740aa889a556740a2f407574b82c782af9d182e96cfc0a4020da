I"Ê<p>Starting in 1995, a dark cloud emerged over JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ when <strong>Alghazanth</strong> was formed. A name taken from within a dream of Gorath Moonthron delivered to him by a â€˜death bringer spirit in the shape of a white wolfâ€™. After 3 demos and a split <strong>Alghazanth</strong> released their first full length <em>The Aeons Envenomed Sanity</em> in 1999 and it was demonic praise to the unholy. Now <strong>Alghazanth</strong> completes their sizable discography with this 8th full length. The aptly named <em>Eight Coffin Nails</em> is in fact the nail in the coffin for this legendary Finnish band. An accumulation of 13 years of occultist symphonic black metal brings us to this funeral album.</p>
