I"„<p>Yeah Iâ€™ll get up on the mic and throw <strong>down!</strong> What are you looking at me like that for? <em>Listen</em> I know that it seems like Iâ€™m just standing up there on edge of the stage. Gripping onto the microphone with white knuckles and jittering, but that doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m scared! Thatâ€™s my hype up game, you fools. None of ya want to stick around and waiting for me to enter into an anxiety induced delirium that invokes confidence in me via now-compromised situational awareness? Sounds like you should go listen to Panic! At the Disco.</p>
