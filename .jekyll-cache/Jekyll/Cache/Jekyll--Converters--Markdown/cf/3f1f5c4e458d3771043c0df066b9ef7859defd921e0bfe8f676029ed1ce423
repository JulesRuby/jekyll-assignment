I"‰<p><strong>Aeons Abyss</strong> is an Australian death metal studio project that has been around since 2017, and have now finished their first full length <em>Impenitent</em> slated for release in November. Apparently the music for this album has been written since the mid 1990â€™s and it was simmering for over a decade when it would finally be unearthed and unleashed around the world.</p>
