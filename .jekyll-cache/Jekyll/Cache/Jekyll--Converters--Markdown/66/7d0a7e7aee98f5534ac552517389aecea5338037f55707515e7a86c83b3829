I"Ù<p>As expected, <em>Two Paths</em> begins with the typical <strong>Ensiferum</strong> intro that starts every album, building the anticipation for the thrust into the moshing music defined by the double kicks, the fast guitar riffs and the gang chants. Brass fanfare and hoarse vocals bring us full circle into the standard <strong>Ensiferum</strong> album. The listener is encouraged to shout and raise their swords, but not for too long as the fats paced parts are quickly intersected with slower choruses and melodies. After 16 years of cranking out high energy folk metal anthems, maybe the band is anticipating the aging of their fan base and making sure it is possible to catch a breath after a quick jaunt in the pit.</p>
